# iot_led_game

For this IoT project I created a memory game using Flask-Ask and leds.

Flask-Ask allows interaction with an Alexa device for voice recognition.

The GPIO pins of a raspberry pi were used to control 4 leds on a breadboard to turn on and off.

The associated json file needs to be loaded into the Alexa Developer Console.

Ngrok needs to be used and properly setup in the Alexa endpoints.

Once all this is setup, simply ask Alexa to "open led color game".

You can follow the commands from there and watch the breadboard to play the game.
